Note, this view function is first being invoked (called) when we enter the local host url with the ending of "bookink/"
and we basically create a GET request for this view. Therefore, the first time we do NOT enter the if statement here
and we only create a form instace object that is empty / not populated with data and we render it with booking.html
and display it to the user - so untill now the user just sees an empty form to fill and submit.
Then, the user fills the reservation form and submits it. When it's submitted a POST request is being created and sent to
the server with the details entered by the user in the body of the request. Also, this view function is being invoked
once again but this time with a POST request - so a form instance object is being created again, but now it's being
populated by the data from the submitted form. Then it's being checked if its valid and if it is then it's saved.
Only, now it's being rendered with the booking.html file, with the details of the user. Also, it's being saved in the
Booking Model to connect to a database table which will save amd store all that information!
